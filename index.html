<p>there is demand in the library community for skills that enable librarians to automate tasks, integrate versioning into workflows, and to clean and manipulate data. Software Carpentry offers this training with a focus on the needs and requirements of research scientists. <b>Library Carpentry</b> will offer this training with a focus on the needs and requirements of library professionals</p>

<pre><code>$ where: City University London
$ when: Monday 9, 13, 23, 30 November 2015, 1730-2030
$ who: library folks who want to develop software skills
</code></pre>

<p><small><b>Library Carpentry</b> is funded by the Software Sustainability Institute, supported by Software Carpentry and City University London, and coordinated by <a href="https://github.com/drjwbaker" class="user-mention">James Baker</a> (Curator, Digital Research, British Library)</small></p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>what is <b>Library Carpentry</b>?</h2>

<p>this exploratory programme of four three-hour sessions held at City University London will be open to 40 to 50 participants. cohorts from across the London area are welcome, ideally booking as a group (we know this helps learning!). places are free but booking will be essential. provisionally the programme will cover the following material:</p>

<pre><code>$ week 1: definitions, regular expressions, generic skills
$ week 2: counting, mining data in the unix shell, NER	
$ week 3: versioning and Git
$ week 4: cleaning data in Open Refine
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>how will it work?</h2>

<p>each session will be lead by a session leader and will primarily involve participants working in groups from a worksheet (hosted on GitHub and iterated by participants). troubleshooting will be handled by skilled volunteers. the programme is subject to change based on the interests of participants and their pace of working. participants will be asked to bring their own laptops and be prepared to share and/or find someone to share with. Software installation will be handled between sessions by the participants (with guidance provided). refreshments will be provided (though participants will be asked to bring their own dinner with them)</p>

<p>we currently have two calls open: a call for participants and a call for volunteers</p>
<p><h3>--call for participants--</h3>if you are interested in finding out more or in bringing a group to <b>Library Carpentry</b>, contact James Baker or comment on our Call for Participants thread. Places will be allocated at the discretion of the organisers.</p>
<p><h3>--call for volunteers--</h3> <b>Library Carpentry</b> needs skilled volunteers to lead sessions, support participants as they work through tasks, help answer questions participants may have, and to contribute to lessons plans as they develop. If you are interested in finding out more or in bringing a group to <b>Library Carpentry</b>, contact James Baker or comment on our Call for Volunteers thread.</p>
